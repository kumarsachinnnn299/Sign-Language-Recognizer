# American Sign Language Recognition
* Developed an AI Sign Language Recognition System in Python to facilitate communication between individuals with speaking impairments and those unfamiliar with sign language.
* Addressed data scarcity by generating a custom dataset through Mediapipe landmark detection.
* Utilized a deep learning architecture comprising three LSTM layers and two Dense layers for accurate gesture recognition.
* Achieved a training accuracy of approximately 65% over 500 epochs.
* Proposed integration of the model into communication platforms for real-time sign language interpretation, potentially reducing reliance on interpreter services.
